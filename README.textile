h1. Datediff

Proof-of-concept implementation of the calculation of difference between two
given dates.

h2. Setup

Datediff does not have any runtime dependencies, and only require RSpec if you
want to run the tests.

h2. Usage

Datediff accepts it's input on STDIN in the format 'DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY':

<pre>
% echo "05 06 2011, 20 06 2011" | ./datediff.rb
05 06 2011, 20 06 2011, 15
</pre>

It can also accept the file, parsing it line-by-line and processing each line as
a separate input:

<pre>
% ./datediff.rb < spec/data/tests.txt
05 06 2011, 20 06 2011, 15
05 06 2011, 20 12 2011, 198
30 05 1993, 20 12 2011, 6778
30 05 1993, 20 12 2011, 6778
20 12 2011, 20 12 2011, 0
31 12 2001, 01 01 2002, 1
28 02 2001, 01 03 2001, 1
</pre>

h2. Algorithm and constraints

Algorithm does not depends on any specific year constraints, and is valid
throughout the whole Gregorian calendar, basically starting with year 1582. The
period given in the task description (1900..2010) is also perfectly valid, of
course.

Details of the algorithm are described in the comments of lib/datediff.rb,
i.e. methods date_to_days and days_to_date. The regression analysis mentioned in
the months calculation as available in the project as regression_analysis.xls
file.
